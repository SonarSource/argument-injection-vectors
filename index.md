A curated list of exploitable options when dealing with argument injection bugs!

Vectors listed below are not vulnerabilities in the associated programs but rather intended features that were proven to be useful to attackers in very specific scenarios. Please don't report or request CVEs for them.

[Contributions]({{ "/contributing/" | relative_url }}) to this list are very welcome. Feel free to open issues [on the repository](https://github.com/SonarSource/argument-injection-vectors) if you would like to see payloads on a specific program, or a pull request if you are already aware of exploitable flags in a target. Links to public write-ups are appreciated when adding a payload.
