**Argument Injection Hammer**

[Argument Injection Hammer](https://github.com/nccgroup/argumentinjectionhammer/) 
is developed by Neil Bergman for NCC Group and contains vectors for most common 
binaries. It integrates with Burp Suite's scanner with in-band vectors, i.e. file write 
under the web root or disclosure of `/etc/passwd`, and timing-based vectors with 
`sleep`. This tool requires a working Jython setup in Burp Suite. More 
information can be found on the [original author's blog](https://d3adend.org/blog/posts/argument-injection-hammer/).
